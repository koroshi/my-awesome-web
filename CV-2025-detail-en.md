     - Technology Stack: nodejs, express, backbone.js, Alibaba Cloud, mongodb
     - **Design Phase**:
       1. Introduced the concept of an authentication center to solve the problem that each project had to independently develop a user system and synchronize between systems in previous projects.
       2. Designed unified permission management and external application access management to solve the problem of unified configuration, storage, and distribution for other microservices' access in subsequent development.
